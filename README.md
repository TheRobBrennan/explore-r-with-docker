# Welcome

This project explores using [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to explore developing applications with the [R](https://www.r-project.org) programming language as quickly as possible using [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/).

If you do not have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your development system, you can download and install the freely available [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
